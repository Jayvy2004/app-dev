# Favorite Movie
I love the movie **The Matrix**. It's a *sci-fi thriller* that explores the concept of simulated reality.

## Plot Summary
- Neo, a computer hacker, discovers the truth about reality.
- He joins a group of rebels to fight against machines that control humanity.

## Why I Love It
- The plot is *mind-bending* and thought-provoking, it's a new concept at that time fore me, whgen I was a kid.
- The special effects are groundbreaking for that time, especially the bullet-dodging scene.
